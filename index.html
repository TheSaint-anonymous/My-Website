			<p>A university student currently studying Bachelor of Forensic Science major in digital forensic. I’m happy to step into university life, which provides more freedom and where, finally, I don’t have to come in a uniform(actually I do like to be in uniform…). <br>Post-university, I aspire to work in an industry that I like.</p>
<p>This website is a project for my Web-systems assignment, it is all about <b>adventure</b> and <b>self-reflection</b>, yet it provides information about my past, current and my future self. I am proud to say this website is my own original work with many hours of Youtube-ing, research and extra studying and learning. I have put  a lot of thoughts into not just the code itself but also the content, the words as well. I hope you can see this beyond the code too.</p>
<p><strong> Thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.</strong></p>
