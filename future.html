			<p>
				Hopefully after finishing university, I can get into an industry that I love in either forensic science or veterinary medicine.</p>
				<p>During the making of this project and from my high school website making experience, I have developed an interest in website making and anything design related including clothing design. I would like to incorporate what I have learnt from university such as making my own website (a prettier one) and put into my future career.
Of course, <strong> would like to retire by the age of 30.</strong><br><br> Heyâ€¦ it is a dream, but I dare to dream about it.<br><br>
How about you? Start Dreaming and it will come true if you work hard enough toward it!</p>
