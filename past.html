<p>Prior to studying this subject, I have <span class="zero"><del><b>zero</b></del></span> experience with computing. Yes… I have done IT subjects in high school, and I have gotten good grade on the subject which covers animation making, website making, video creating. So… you know what, actually I <strong>DO</strong> have some experience in IT and computer so that’s why there is a strikethrough on the word <b>ZERO</b>.<br>So far during my course, I have completed Fundamental of programming in Java language.</p>
<p>After high school I have pursued into the veterinary industry which I wanted and completed my <i>Certificate IV in Veterinary nursing</i>. I have been working in the industry for as long as I remember.</p> 
<p>I am currently an ECC (Emergency and Critical Care) vet nurse. During my experience I have learn valuable skills such as:<br>
<ul>
	<li>CPR</li>
	<li>Phlebotomy</li>
	<li>Teaching</li>
	<li>Advance procedures such as 
		<ul>
			<li>Open chest CPR</li>
			<li>Central venous catheterisation - placing catheter into the jugular vein</li>
			<li>Arterial blood sampling</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>So on...</li>
	
</ul>

And I have made many good friends along the way.</p>
